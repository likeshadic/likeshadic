# Hey, I'm Daniel Campbell 👋

I'm a System Administrator building toward DevOps and Cloud Engineering. I'm passionate about infrastructure automation, containerization, and building systems that are reliable, observable, and secure.

I learn best by building — so I run a homelab and work on cloud projects that mirror real-world production environments.

## 🔧 What I'm Working With

**Cloud & IaC:** AWS · Azure · Terraform · Ansible  
**Containers & Orchestration:** Docker · Kubernetes  
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions  
**Monitoring & Observability:** Grafana · Prometheus  
**Virtualization & Networking:** Proxmox · Pi-hole · DNS · VLANs

## 🏗️ Featured Projects

### [SentinelDeploy](https://github.com/likeshadic/sentineldeploy)
A secure, automated container deployment platform on Azure. Built with Terraform and GitHub Actions, it integrates security scanning, secrets management, and centralized monitoring into a complete CI/CD pipeline.

### [Homelab — Proxmox Server](https://github.com/likeshadic/homelab-proxmox-server)
My home infrastructure running on Proxmox, hosting containerized services including Grafana, Prometheus, Portainer, and more. Designed to simulate enterprise-style monitoring and container management at a personal scale.

### [Homelab — Pi-hole on Raspberry Pi 5](https://github.com/likeshadic/homelab-project-pihole)
A containerized Pi-hole deployment on a Raspberry Pi 5 providing network-wide DNS filtering and ad blocking.

### Network Anomaly Detector *(coming soon)*
A Raspberry Pi running an inference engine to detect anomalous network traffic — combining edge computing with machine learning for real-time security monitoring.
